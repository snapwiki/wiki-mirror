These blocks are used for <a href="https://snapwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Variables" title="Variables">variables</a>. The variables pane also contains <a href="https://snapwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Lists_(block_category)" title="Lists (block category)">list</a> and "other" blocks. There have been various discussions on the creation of 'cloud variables' as there are in the well known block programming website (which Snap<i>!</i> is based off) <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>. The Snap<i>!</i> developers have said that they will not be adding these 'We're a little afraid of them, because it's one more thing to have to police, but people finding a way to use someone else's cloud variable server is a perfect solution!'. The Snap<i>!</i> developers have allowed users to create there own cloud variable systems which they can run off their own servers. Many users have created there own servers to run 'cloud variables' on, they are only accessible through block downloads as the previous quote sums, the Snap<i>!</i> developers do not want anything to do with these sorts of variables.<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Variables">Variables</span></h2><table class="wikitable"><tbody><tr><th>Block</th><th>Function</th><th>Options</th></tr><tr><td><code class="blocks">(variable)</code></td><td>Gets the value of a variable named by the block spec.</td><td>No other block reads its own block spec.
