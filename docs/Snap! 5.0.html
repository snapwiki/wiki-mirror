<div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Snap<i>!</i> 5.0 was released on June 27, 2019. It most notably added automatic conversion of text, spreadsheet (CSV), or JSON files that are dragged onto the Snap<i>!</i> window to lists, in a variable named after the filename. An option in the variable watcher allows for conversion in the other direction, from structured list to text.</p><div id="toc" class="toc" role="navigation" aria-labelledby="mw-toc-heading"><input type="checkbox" role="button" id="toctogglecheckbox" class="toctogglecheckbox" style="display:none"><div class="toctitle" lang="en" dir="ltr"><h2 id="mw-toc-heading">Contents</h2><span class="toctogglespan"><label class="toctogglelabel" for="toctogglecheckbox"></label></span></div><ul><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-1"><a href="#New_Blocks"><span class="tocnumber">1</span> <span class="toctext">New Blocks</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-2"><a href="#Notable_Changes"><span class="tocnumber">2</span> <span class="toctext">Notable Changes</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-3"><a href="#Website_Update"><span class="tocnumber">3</span> <span class="toctext">Website Update</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-4"><a href="#Snap!_5.1"><span class="tocnumber">4</span> <span class="toctext">Snap<i>!</i> 5.1</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-5"><a href="#Snap!_5.2"><span class="tocnumber">5</span> <span class="toctext">Snap<i>!</i> 5.2</span></a></li><li class="toclevel-1 tocsection-6"><a href="#YouTube_Video_Demonstrating_New_Data_Science_Features"><span class="tocnumber">6</span> <span class="toctext">YouTube Video Demonstrating New Data Science Features</span></a></li></ul></div><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Blocks">New Blocks</span></h2><p>Many new primitives were added for media computation, allowing manipulation of costumes and sounds, with access to individual pixels or samples, respectively.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notable_Changes">Notable Changes</span></h2><p>Alongside the new media computation features a very notable change was that many blocks previously included in the Tools library became primitives. This change is intimately related to the media computation features, which made it important to be able to process lists with hundreds of thousands of items quickly. The downside of this change is that it robs learners of the experience of writing blocks such as <b>map</b> or <b>for</b> <i>in Snap! itself,</i> with very short, simple scripts. (That is, learners can still do that, but they're less likely to see a need for it when those tools are provided automatically.)</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Website_Update">Website Update</span></h2><p>The former static home page at <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="https://snap.berkeley.edu">https://snap.berkeley.edu</a> was replaced with a dynamic community site with featured projects, recent projects, per-user display of published projects, and so on, similar to the Scratch site but less featureful. A separate but linked Discourse-powered forum was added later.</p><h2><span id="Snap.21_5.1"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Snap!_5.1">Snap<i>!</i> 5.1</span></h2><p>Snap<i>!</i> 5.1 was released on August 8, 2019. It had improvements to the media computation primitives, a new <b>paste on</b> block that stamps a sprite onto another sprite rather than onto the stage, and the important ability to change the temporary/permanent status of a clone programmatically (in a script).</p><h2><span id="Snap.21_5.2"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Snap!_5.2">Snap<i>!</i> 5.2</span></h2><p>Snap<i>!</i> 5.2 was released on October 24, 2019. It added further improvements to media computation, most notably the constructors <b>new costume</b> and <b>new sound</b> to create anonymous media objects from their components (pixels or samples).</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="YouTube_Video_Demonstrating_New_Data_Science_Features">YouTube Video Demonstrating New Data Science Features</span></h2><p>Snap<i>!</i> developer Jens Mönig made the following YouTube video before the Snap<i>!</i> 5.0 release demonstrating new data science features:<iframe width="930" height="600" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6H8vK8Q5KeY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div>
