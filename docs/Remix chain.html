<div class="mw-parser-output"><p>A remix chain is a project where you remix and then remix the remix and then remix the remix of the remix and so on. Usually these are used for counting aka first remix says 1 and then the next says 2 and so on. Dubstepv1 is a user on Snap! that brought remix chains from scratch to Snap! Dubstepv1 was banned on scratch leading him to get bored and make the first instance of a remix chain. The first known remix chain is called the remix number or known as TFRCOS! (The First Remix Chain On Snap!) This is currently the only remix chain known to exist but there could be one out there we don't know about.</p></div>
