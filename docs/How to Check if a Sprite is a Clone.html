<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>There are ways to check if a sprite is a clone.</p><p>Note that it only works for temporary clones which are created programmatically.</p><meta property="mw:PageProp/toc"><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Temporary_Check">Temporary Check</span></h2><p>Since a clone is usually temporary, you can just check if it is temporary.</p><pre class="blocks">(my [temporary? V])
</pre><p>While this is not a surefire solution, as you can have permanent clones, it still works for most cases, as permanent clones don't come up very often.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Parent">Parent</span></h2><p>Another solution is to check if the clone has a parent.</p><pre class="blocks">&lt;is (my [parent V]) a [sprite V]&nbsp;?&gt;
</pre><p>This is also not a perfect solution, since you can set the parent of regular sprites.</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="My_Clones">My Clones</span></h2><p>A sprite has a list of all their temporary clones in <code class="blocks">(my [clones V])</code>, which can be used in combination with <code class="blocks">(ask [ V] for (() @addInput) @verticalEllipsis @addInput)</code> and <code class="blocks">(my [parent V])</code> to determine if a sprite is a clone.</p><pre class="blocks">(if (my [parent V]) then &lt;(ask (my [parent V]) for ((my [clones V]) @addInput) @verticalEllipsis @addInput) contains (my [self V])&gt; else &lt;false&gt;)
</pre><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Manually">Manually</span></h2><p>You can create a sprite-only variable, and then set it to false in the sprite, and true in clones.</p><pre class="blocks">when flag clicked
set [clone? V] to &lt;false&gt;

when I start as a clone
set [clone? V] to &lt;true&gt;
</pre><p>This works very well, because sprite-only variables are unique to each clone.</p></div>
