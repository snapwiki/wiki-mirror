<div class="mw-parser-output"><p><br>Some things look the same and work the same, some things look the same and work a bit differently and of course, there are a lot of new features that Scratch simply does not have.</p><p>You can simply add a When GF block, a forever loop, and a move and turn block and when you press the Green Flag, your sprite will move around in a circle just like Scratch.</p><p><i>However you might have noticed a yellow pause in-between the Flag and the stop button. Press it and your script will pause - pressing it again - it will resume from where it left off.</i><br></p><table class="wikitable"><caption></caption><tbody><tr><th>Block</th><th>Scratch</th><th>Snap!</th></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div>
