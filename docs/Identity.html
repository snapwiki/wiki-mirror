<div class="mw-parser-output"><p>Identity is a reporter block and comes from multiple libraries. It reports the value that is just typed in. It appears in the following libraries:</p><ul><li>List utilities</li><li>Colors and Crayons</li><li>Bignums, rationals, complex #s (used for typing symbols where a normal number input would reject)</li><li>APL primitives (appears differently, having the word identity and a plus symbol)</li></ul></div>
