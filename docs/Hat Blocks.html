<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>A <b>hat block</b> is a block placed at the top of a script to run it once an event was triggered. Top level scripts without hat blocks will never run (unless clicked). Hat blocks cannot be placed inside scripts, with or without rings. In Snap 6.0, there are 6 hat blocks, one only for sprites. All hat blocks are currently in control.</p><table class="wikitable"><tbody><tr><th>Block</th><th>Function</th><th>Options</th></tr><tr><td><code class="blocks">when flag clicked</code></td><td>Triggers when the <a href="https://snapwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Green_Flag" title="Green Flag">green flag</a> is clicked by the user.</td></tr><tr><td><code class="blocks">when [space V] key pressed</code></td><td>Triggers when the key selected is pressed. <a href="https://snapwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Thread_Safe_Scripts?action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thread Safe Scripts (page does not exist)">Thread safe scripts</a> is always on for these scripts.
