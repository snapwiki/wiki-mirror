It enables users to create 3D projects, similar to a Snap<i>!</i> modification titled <a href="https://snapwiki.miraheze.org/wiki/Beetle_Blocks" title="Beetle Blocks">Beetle Blocks</a>.</p><p>Importing this library will automatically load the extension, consequently the "Open 3D Window" button will appear on top of the "Make a block" button. The 3D Window shows an interactive view of the current 3D scene, along with multiple options and a button to export:</p><ul><li>Toggle visibillity of the beetle, grid, XYZ axes and extrusion base</li><li>Toggle wireframe</li><li>Toggle ghost mode, which makes extruded shapes transparent</li><li>Toggle first person view, positioning the view to the facing direction of the beetle</li><li>Toggle orthographic mode</li><li>Zoom to fit</li><li>Reset the camera</li></ul><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blocks">Blocks</span></h2><pre class="blocks">reset::#5CB5FF // resets the entire 3D scene

go home::#5CB5FF // moves the beetle to 0, 0, 0

move (1) steps::#5CB5FF // moves the beetle relatively to its direction

go to @list::#5CB5FF // drop a three-input list into the slot

set [x V] position to (3)::#5CB5FF

change absolute [x V] by (2)::#5CB5FF

change relative [x V] by (2)::#5CB5FF
([x V] position::#5CB5FF)
rotate [z V] by (15)::#5CB5FF

set [z V] rotation to (45)::#5CB5FF

point to @list::#5CB5FF
([z V] rotation::#5CB5FF)
start extruding [circle V]::#5CB5FF // similar to pen down in 2D space, leaves trails of a shape as the beetle moves. available options: circle, triangle, square, semicircle, line, point and sprite positions

stop extruding::#5CB5FF

log sprite positions in {
}::#5CB5FF
(shape points::#5CB5FF)
set shape offset to @list::#5CB5FF

set [shape V] scale to (1)::#5CB5FF // available options: shape, movement

change [shape V] scale by (1)::#5CB5FF
([shape V] scale::#5CB5FF)
push position::#5CB5FF

pop position::#5CB5FF
(beetle view::#5CB5FF) // reports the current view of the 3D space
