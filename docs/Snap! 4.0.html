Development started in 2011, about the same time that the Scratch Team started working on Scratch 2.0. They, too, wanted to run in a browser. One difference between the two projects was that Scratch chose to use Adobe Flash, whereas Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[421,426,2,2]}'>!</i> was built around HTML5 Canvas. Both teams knew that Flash was a moribund technology, and Canvas just beginning, but the Scratch Team felt that they couldn't afford to lose access to the user's camera and microphone, and the ability to use the MIDI musical instrument timbres. None of those were available in HTML5 in 2011. By contrast, the Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[771,776,2,2]}'>!</i> team, with no budget and one developer, needed 4.0 to be on a platform that would last a long time. BYOB3 was based on the Scratch 1.4 source code, but Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[933,938,2,2]}'>!</i> is entirely separate from Scratch 2.0 and later.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1005,1442,0,0]}'>From the beginning of using BYOB in high schools, there were a few complaints about the inappropriateness of the name. Experience has shown that people outside the USA don't understand why this pun could be considered inappropriate, and even in the USA hardly anyone has seen a problem with it. But the few who did complain were <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1334,1342,2,2]}'>very</i> emphatic about it, saying that their schools would never allow them to use software with that name.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1444,1885,0,0]}'>So, reluctantly, the team looked for a somewhat relevant name that wasn't already the name of a programming language. Nobody really <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1576,1585,2,2]}'>loved</i> "Snap," which doesn't suggest much personality, but at least the blocks snap together. Brian Harvey, Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1691,1697,2,2]}'>!'</i>s co-developer insisted on adding the exclamation point, for a slight suggestion of personality, and it became italicized after Scratcher nXIII designed the logo, in which it's italicized.</p>

In addition, Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[1977,1982,2,2]}'>!</i> 4.0 introduced first class continuations, Web access, linked lists, and the ability to write custom blocks in JavaScript.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2148,2767,0,0]}'>Prior to joining the Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2173,2178,2,2]}'>!</i> project, Bharvey had spent 20 years teaching computer science using what many people consider the best introductory CS textbook, <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2308,2361,2,2]}'>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> (<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2363,2371,2,2]}'>SICP</i>). The course uses the Scheme programming language, although it's not <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2441,2450,2,2]}'>about</i> Scheme, because it's the language that provides the greatest versatility in supporting different programming styles with the least amount of syntax to get in the way. Scheme has been the model for BYOB/Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2657,2662,2,2]}'>!</i> language design since BYOB 3.0. One of the team's slogans is "Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2729,2734,2,2]}'>!</i> is Scheme disguised as Scratch."</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2769,3179,0,0]}'>BYOB 3.0 was perhaps 90% of a Scheme implementation, enough to teach a <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[2840,2848,2,2]}'>SICP</i>-based course, but missing two main advanced capabilities. One, macros, is half-implemented since BYOB 3.0, namely the ability for a custom block to have unevaluated inputs. (The other half, the ability to inject code into the caller of the block, is still to come.) The second big advanced capability is first class continuations.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[3181,3562,0,0]}'>The <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[3185,3201,2,2]}'>continuation</i> of a block in a script is the part of the computation that remains to be done when that block has been run. For a command block, this generally means the blocks below it in the script (plus whatever remains of the script that called this block, and so on). For a reporter, it means the block to which this block provides an input, plus whatever comes below it.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[3564,4207,0,0]}'>Continuations are not a special feature of Scheme. Any part of a computation, in any language, has a continuation—whatever is left to do after it finishes. But in most languages, the programmer isn't called upon to think of the continuation as a <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[3812,3822,2,2]}'>thing,</i> although the implementor of the programming language does think about continuations. What's special about Scheme is that it treats continuations as first class data. Giving the programmer access to continuations allows users to write any control structure; the most common examples are nonlocal exit (<b data-parsoid='{"dsr":[4124,4135,3,3]}'>catch</b> and <b data-parsoid='{"dsr":[4140,4151,3,3]}'>throw</b> in the Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[4163,4168,2,2]}'>!</i> tools library) and a thread scheduler.</p>

Sometimes a "CORS proxy" site can be used to get around the problem; details are beyond the scope of this article.</p>

</section><section data-mw-section-id="5" data-parsoid="{}"><h4 id="Linked_lists" data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5076,5098,4,4]}'>Linked lists</h4>
<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5099,5680,0,0]}'>The data structure that Scratch (and therefore BYOB) calls a "list" is actually implemented as a <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5196,5214,2,2]}'>dynamic array,</i> i.e., a contiguous block of memory that is expanded as needed. A <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5280,5295,2,2]}'>linked list</i> is a different data structure made out of <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5338,5348,2,2]}'>pairs;</i> each pair contains one list item plus a pointer to another pair, so the entire list contains as many pairs as items, and they don't have to be contiguous in memory.

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[5682,5886,0,0]}'>For example, given a list of numbers <code class="blocks" data-parsoid='{"stx":"html","dsr":[5719,5747,21,7]}'></code>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[6389,7148,0,0]}'>It is a goal of Snap<i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[6409,6414,2,2]}'>!</i> that users not have to know anything about data structures, but should still have their project run as fast as possible.

The only time the resulting programs aren't as efficient as possible is if the user uses both styles of programming with the same list, which must then be converted from one form to the other.

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[12132,12685,0,0]}'>The ability to write and invoke procedures, which is the core idea of Build Your Own Blocks, has been part of almost every programming language (with hardware support in every processor design at least to the extent of an instruction to save the return address somewhere before jumping to the procedure) in the history of computing. (In the original Fortran, the first general-purpose high level programming language, procedures were not reentrant, like Scratch scripts, which break off in the middle if the event that started the script happens again.)</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[12733,13301,0,0]}'>Among languages intended primarily for children, there were heated debates between BASIC and Logo advocates because the latter included support for recursive procedures and the former did not, limiting itself instead to something pretty similar to the Scratch Broadcast () and Wait block. There's an irony in this, since the Scratch Team is a descendant of the old MIT Logo Lab. Seymour Papert, one of Logo's inventors and the founder of the MIT Logo Lab, argued for recursion as one of the mathematical big ideas that children should learn from programming computers.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13328,13545,0,0]}'>The phrase "first class data" was coined by computer scientist Christopher Strachey, who argued in the 1960s that any data type that exists in a language at all should be first class. This means that data of that type</p>

<ul data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13547,13751,0,0]}'><li data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13547,13580,1,0]}'>can be the value of a variable.</li>

<li data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13632,13665,1,0]}'>can be reported by a procedure.</li>
<li data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13666,13716,1,0]}'>can be a member of an aggregate (Scratch: list).</li>
<li data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13717,13751,1,0]}'>can exist without having a name.</li></ul>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[13753,14138,0,0]}'>It's easy to see why one might want lists of lists; every data structure (trees, heaps, hash tables, etc.) can be constructed out of lists, but not straightforwardly with only lists of text strings. But why should procedures be first class? This was historically a counterintuitive idea, especially because a procedure can not be recursive unless it has a name by which to call itself.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[14140,14610,0,0]}'>The idea of first class procedures comes ultimately from the 1936 invention by mathematician Alonzo Church of lambda calculus, which is a formal study of the behavior of functions. In 1936 there were only a handful of experimental computers, and no symbolic programming languages, so the fact that lambda calculus turned out to be of practical use (it is the basis for much of the theory of programming languages today) was a great confirmation of the power of the idea.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[14612,15202,0,0]}'>Church demonstrated that the ability to create and call functions is <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[14681,14694,2,2]}'>universal</i> Template:- it is all that is needed to perform any computation that can be done at all. (He also proved that there are undecidable problems, which is the reason for the qualifying clause above.) In BYOB terms, this means a programming language with nothing but THE BLOCK and CALL could exist, and still be able to compute any function. (See this BYOB project description for an explanation of how to invent arithmetic from that starting point.) The Greek letter lambda (λ) is Church's name for a gray ring.</p>
<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[15203,15500,0,0]}'>
<br data-parsoid='{"dsr":[15204,15204,0,0]}'/>
(Of course lambda does not solve the problem of input/output: capturing mouse clicks, drawing pictures on the screen, and so on. Although obviously of crucial practical importance, such input/output activities are not central to the understanding of what a program or a programming language is.)</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[15502,16039,0,0]}'>Church's work influenced actual programming language design by way of John McCarthy's 1958 invention of the Lisp programming language for artificial intelligence research. Lisp is a direct influence on Logo, and therefore an indirect influence on Scratch. The detailed design of first class procedures in Build Your Own Blocks was strongly influenced by Scheme, a Lisp dialect invented in the late 1970s by Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy Steele, which brought Lisp closer to its roots in lambda calculus by introducing lexical scoping rules.</p>

<p data-parsoid='{"dsr":[16061,16758,0,0]}'>The <b data-parsoid='{"dsr":[16065,16076,3,3]}'>clone</b> block reports a new object that inherits properties of the parent object. This allows users to create an object hierarchy, as in other OOP languages such as Smalltalk. But unlike Smalltalk, Build Your Own Blocks does not distinguish between classes and instances; every object can be viewed as an instance of its parent or as the class of its children. This form of inheritance is called "prototyping" because the user builds an <i data-parsoid='{"dsr":[16506,16517,2,2]}'>example</i> of a category of sprite rather than building the category as an abstract description. The best known prototyping languages are JavaScript and Self. The particular form of prototyping used in BYOB was inspired by the work of Henry Lieberman.</p>
